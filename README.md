# basic-express-server

* ## In this task.
 >I wrote two routing :
  -  1) "/" 
 - 2) "/person": checked from middleware if client wrote params name after the path return object, else (next) function displays the error.

> Also using two middleware:
* one global 
* another special for '/person' route.

> Write two functions to error handler
 * (500 for the problem the server) 
 * (404 not found route).

> After that, I create three tests
 + Two for middleware 
 + One for testing server in general.

>finally, I did testing locally & deploy on heroku.
